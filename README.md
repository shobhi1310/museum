we are working with this **delhi based museum website** <http://www.nationalmuseumindia.gov.in/prodCollections.asp?pid=80&id=8&lk=dp8> 

* bs.py - uses beautiful soup to scrape delhi website
* bs2.py - uses beautiful soup and prints out the entire html page using html5lib parser from the **IITTP website** <http://gcu.iittp.ac.in/home>
* data.csv - has all the data scraped from the delhi based museum website
* debug.log - not so necessary It is just a log file
* **hack.py** - should/can be neglected as it is just a simple file for testing purposes.
* image_url.py - just avoid it, needs to be deleted soon enough but kept for some tests.
* india_geo.code-workspace - Is to be used for creating the map of India usinf geomapping of d3
* maps.html - you can run it in your system to get some visual feel of the way we are depicting museum data
* mus.txt - is the output generated using beautiful soup and has been properly indented for human-readable form
* **musAdv.py** - this is the currently being worked upon .py file for getting all the important museum-data/meta-data
